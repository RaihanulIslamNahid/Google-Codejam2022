* Python3 solutions of Google Code Jam 2022. Solution begins with `*` means it will get TLE in the largest data set.
* Total computation amount > `10^8` is not friendly for Python3 to solve in 5 ~ 15 seconds.
* A problem was marked as `Very Hard` means that it was an unsolved one during the contest and may not be that difficult.
